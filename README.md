# Grocery App
This is a simple app for creating and updating a grocery list. The app began as a simple Python app with a SQLite3 database. There are several enhancements planned for this app, including:
- [X] Add a simple frontend to add, remove, and display items on the list
- [ ] Add a 'smart' feature to track previous purchases and suggest common items missing from the current list
- [ ] Add the ability to track pricing for each item and overall list budget
- [ ] Add price comparisons from several stores
- [ ] Add option to select stores nearby for pricing
- [ ] Add ability to search a store or a set of stores for a specific product with current prices
- [ ] Add similar item suggestions for search items (found and not found)
- [ ] Anything else I can think of
