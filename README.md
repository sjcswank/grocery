# Grocery App
This is a simple app for creating and updating a grocery list. The app began as a simple Python app with a SQLite3 database. There are several possible enhancements planned for this app, including:
- [X] Add a simple frontend to add, remove, and display items on the list
- [ ] Add a 'smart' feature to track previous purchases and suggest common items missing from the current list
- [ ] Add the ability to track pricing for each item and overall list budget
- [ ] Add ability to search a store or a set of stores for a specific product with current prices
- [ ] Add price comparisons from several stores
- [ ] Add ability to select best price and create store specific lists
- [ ] Add functionality to auto select best price and separate items into store lists
- [ ] Add option to select stores nearby for pricing
- [ ] Add similar item suggestions for search items (found and not found)
- [ ] Add ability to use coupons and discount codes (maybe a way to search for these, too?)
- [ ] Add ability to purchase a store list, with delivery options
- [ ] Add an inventory section to track current items (manual update)
- [ ] Add ability to connect to smart fridges to auto update supply
- [ ] Add ability to scan UPCs as you shop to auto-update lists, inventory, expiration dates, etc.
- [ ] Add voice updates
- [ ] Add AI integration
- [ ] Anything else I can think of!
